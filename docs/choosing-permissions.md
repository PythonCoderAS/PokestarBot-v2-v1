Discord bots have a varied level of permissions. PokestarBot is designed to work with whatever permissions it is given, however for the most optimal usage it is recommended to give a blanket permission of administrator, since that allows the bot to view all channels, which is required for having an accurate message count.

In general, the bot needs to be able to speak in any channel that is assigned to during bot setup. The bot also needs to be able to send embeds as well. Furthermore, the following functions require the given permissions:

| **Capability** | **Permissions Needed** |
| --- | --- |
| Mass Role Management | Manage Roles |
| Mass Kick | Kick Members |
| Mass Move | Move Members |
| Mass Mute | Mute Members |
| Mass Unmute | Mute Members |
| Mass Deafen | Deafen Members |
| Mass Undeafen | Deafen Members |
| Create Missing Channels | Manage Channels |

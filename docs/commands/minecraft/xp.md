*Parent:* [*minecraft*](/commands/minecraft)

Root command for dealing with experience. When called directly, shows a list of subcommands.

*Syntax:* `*minecraft xp*`

# Experience Levels

The bot stores raw experience, but all commands that use experience use a certain amount of experience levels. The formula for experience levels follows the one used in Minecraft. The experience formula can be found [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_Formula). A table with experience data up to level 50 has been provided. A chart with experience data up to level 1000 can be located [here](/commands/minecraft/xp/levels), and values for any level above that can be found with the [mc xp calculate](/commands/minecraft/xp/calculate) command.

PokestarBot can be separated into 3 versions:

-   Version 0, the test bot that I made.
-   Version 1, the first public version of PokestarBot. As of August 2021, it is the version running under the PokestarBot account.
-   Version 2, the second public version of PokestarBot, and in development. As of August 2021, it is the version running under the PokestarBotTest account.

Version 1 is deprecated and will not receive any bug fixes. Once Version 2 has sufficient features, it will be moved to the PokestarBot account, and the PokestarBotTest account will be offline.
